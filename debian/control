Description: generates and inspects UUIDs based on RFC 4122
 This package generates and inspects UUIDs based on RFC 4122
 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) and DCE 1.1: Authentication and
 Security Services.
 .
 This package is based on the "github.com/pborman/uuid" package. It differs
 from these earlier packages in that a UUID is a 16 byte array rather than
 a byte slice. One loss due to this change is the ability to represent an
 invalid UUID (vs a NIL UUID).
